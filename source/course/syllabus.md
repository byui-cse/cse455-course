## CSE 455 Course Overview

Welcome to CSE 455 - Developing AI Systems

## Course Objectives

* Design and implement end-to-end AI systems. 
* Deploy AI systems into working environments. 
* Improve performance of a live AI system based on evaluation and monitoring. 
* Articulate the challenges of real-time, streaming data. 
* Identify ethical impacts of AI systems. 


!!!note "Course Textbook"

	There is no textbook for this course. All information is found on the BYU-Idaho Canvas site.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into two introductory projects and then a team project. The team project will be completed over four *sprints*. Each sprint will last approximately two weeks. Each of these sprints will be completed as teams. You will be required to provide feedback to your teammates at the end of each sprint as well as reflect on your learning.

!!! warning "Subject to Change"
	
	Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class, MS Teams, and Canvas announcements.

!!!note "Time Expectations" 
	University guidelines suggest that students spend an average of three hours per week per credit hour.

	While there will be some time provided in class for team assignments for campus students, as this is a three credit course, the expectation is that students will spend an average of six hours per week on assignments outside of class.


### Introductory Projects

A guided experience of integrating a machine learning model into a working system. You'll label data, train a model, deploy your model, evaluate the model, and make adjustments to improve the system. See [module 1](../module-01) and [module 2](../module-02) for details.

### Team Project

You'll work in teams of 3 to build an AI system of your choice. Your project must be approved by your instructor.

### Mini Lessons

During the team project portion of the course, you'll be given small lessons on how to use LLMs more efficiently and effectively in an AI system.

## Grading

See your Canvas section for exact grade weights for each assignment, but in general, assignments are weighted similar to the following:

 * Module 01 - Example Case Study 1: 5%
 * Module 01 - Example Case Study 1 Executive Summary: 5%
 * Module 02 - Example Case Study 2: 5%
 * Module 02 - Example Case Study 2 Executive Summary: 5%
 * Module 03 - Team Project: 30%
 * Module 03 - Team Project Personal Contribution and Attendance: 20%
 * Module 03 - Team Project Executive Summary: 10%
 * Module 03 - Team Project Presentation: 10%
 * Module 03 - Mini Exercises: 10%


Final Letter grades are given according to the [standard BYU-Idaho grading scale](https://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/grading-system).
 

## Late Policy

Because of the team-based, interactive nature of this course, no late credit is given. 


## Student Support

Support is available in many ways including via other class members, tutoring, and instructor student hours. In addition, help is available through [the university's academic support center](http://www.byui.edu/academic-support-centers).

## Dress and Grooming

You are expected to follow the university's [Dress and Grooming Standards](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/dress-and-grooming)

This includes any [current university requirements and/or guidelines](https://www.byui.edu/covid-19-updates) related to wearing masks and/or social distancing.


## Preventing Sexual Misconduct

BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination by its employees and students in all of its education programs or activities. This includes all forms of sexual harassment, such as sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, conditioning a grade or job on participation in sexual conduct, and other forms of unwelcome sexual conduct.

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. University policy requires deans and department chairs, and encourages all faculty, to report every incident of sexual harassment that comes to their attention. If you encounter or experience sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at [titleix@byui.edu](mailto:titleix@byui.edu) or 208-496-9209. Additional information about sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and available resources can be found at [www.byui.edu/titleix](www.byui.edu/titleix)

## Disability Services

BYU-Idaho does not discriminate against persons with disabilities in providing its educational and administrative services and programs and follows applicable federal and state law. This policy extends to the University’s electronic and information technologies (EIT).

Students with qualifying disabilities should contact the Disability Services Office at disabilityservices@byui.edu or 208-496-9210. Additional information about Disability Services resources can be found at [http://www.byui.edu/disabilities](http://www.byui.edu/disabilities).

## Academic Honesty

> “When you are honest in every way, you are able to enjoy peace of mind and maintain self-respect. You build strength of character, which allows you to be of service to God and others. You are trustworthy in the eyes of God and those around you. If you are dishonest in your words or actions, you hurt yourself and often hurt others as well. If you lie, steal, cheat, or neglect to give the full amount of work for your pay, you lose your self-respect. You lose the guidance of the Holy Ghost” (“Honesty,” True to the Faith (2004), 84)

Academic Honesty means students do their own work. This also means their instructors will evaluate that work. Students should not be dishonest—this includes all types of work in their courses. The complete Academic Honesty Policy can be found at [http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty).

## Academic Grievances

Students are encouraged to contact their instructors regarding course-related concerns. If concerns cannot be resolved in this way, students may contact the [BYU-Idaho Support Center](http://www.byui.edu/contact-us). to formally register a concern or grievance. The [Student Grievance Policy](https://content.byui.edu/integ/gen/d42e66fd-6e72-448f-a4c2-4d88a4ed26d2/0/Final%20Student%20Grievance%20Policy%20-%20catalog%20version.docx). can be found here.

## Changes to Schedule and Assignments

Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be notified of any changes on I-learn.

## Generative AI Policy

The "Generative AI Usage Policy" for the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department provides guidelines for the ethical and practical use of generative AI in education and software development. It encourages students to utilize AI tools for enhancing learning, creativity, and productivity while requiring them to disclose AI assistance in their work. This policy aims to integrate generative AI into the curriculum, fostering a balanced and innovative learning environment. The [CSE Generative AI Policy](https://byui-cse.github.io/department/student-resources/generative-ai/generative-ai-policy.html) can be found here.
